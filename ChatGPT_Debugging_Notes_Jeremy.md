That error message is Windows telling you that your program **can’t find a required DLL file**. Let’s break it down:

---

### 1. What is `MSVCP140D.dll`?

* **MSVCP140.dll** is part of the **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**. It contains standard C++ runtime functions (things like string handling, memory management, etc.) that many Windows programs rely on.
* The **“D” at the end (`MSVCP140D.dll`)** is important:

  * The “D” means **Debug version**.
  * It’s not normally included with the regular Visual C++ Redistributable. Instead, it’s only installed if you have **Visual Studio (the full developer IDE)** with debug libraries.

---

### 2. Why are you seeing this error?

* The program you’re trying to run (`PerudoGame.exe`) was **compiled in Debug mode** instead of Release mode.
* That means the developer accidentally packaged it in a way that depends on debug-only files.
* On a computer without Visual Studio installed, Windows can’t find `MSVCP140D.dll`.

### 3. How to fix it

You’ve got two main options:

#### ✅ Easiest Fix (what most users do):

* **Ask the developer** (or if you built it yourself, recompile it) to provide a **Release build**.

  * A Release build does not depend on `MSVCP140D.dll`, only on the standard redistributable DLLs.

#### ✅ Workaround (if you just need it running now):

1. Install **Visual Studio Community Edition** (free) → during setup, check “Desktop development with C++”. That will install the debug DLLs, including `MSVCP140D.dll`.

   * This is a big install (gigabytes), but it works.
2. OR, if you built this yourself: **switch to Release mode** in your IDE and rebuild. Then you can run it without needing debug DLLs.

### 4. Why does it say “Reinstalling may fix this”?

That’s just Windows’ generic message when a DLL is missing. In this case, reinstalling usually won’t help unless the developer repackages the program properly.

---

👉 Quick summary:
Your program is looking for the **Debug C++ runtime DLL**, which normal users don’t have. Best solution: **get or build a Release version of the program**.

Do you want me to walk you through how to recompile this into a Release build (if you have the code), or do you just want the quickest way to make the existing `.exe` run on your machine?
